\chapter*{Abstract}
Recommender systems are at the core most modern businesses. It solves the non-trivial problem of keeping high user engagement with a service being provided by ensuring attempting to suggest items to that is both personalized and desired by each specific user. Because of this recommender systems have become an important and heavily active important area of research, gathering a variety of different algorithms and now more recently, being approached by from the Machine Learning world. This project aims to explore and exploit the benefits of recommender systems via a Trail running website. This also proposes the problem of building a highly interactive acutely complex modern web application, one that requires a map interface to offer trail creation capabilities and a view for trail presentation. Hence we also need to examine the various technologies award an expert production.
