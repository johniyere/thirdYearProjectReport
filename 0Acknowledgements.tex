\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. James Miles for his continued support and guidance throughout the entire life-cycle of this project. Without his advice, this process would have been even more difficult than it already was.

I would also like to express my gratitude to my friends and family for their continued encouragement during the project.

Finally I would like to declare the deepest and greatest appreciation to my mum, for being nonstop strength and cheer-leading that she unrelentingly offered.
