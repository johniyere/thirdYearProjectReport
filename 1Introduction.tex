\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:Intro}
Trail Running is an activity that involves running a path generally stationed in a natural environment, such as forested or hilly spaces \cite{wiki:TrailRunning}. It is an activity upheld by a large number of participants and, as with most activities, has garnered a community whom require a means of facilitating the creation and discovery of trails within the community. Hence we are presented with three main issues this project aims to resolve:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Provide an interface that buoys astute \textbf{trail creation} as discussed in chapter \ref{chap:TrailInterface}.
    \item Create a \textbf{platform} that encourages sharing and critiquing of these created trails within a community discussed in chapter \ref{chap:Architecture}.
    \item Design a system that cleverly \textbf{recommends} new trails are best suited to a specific user discussed in chapter \ref{chap:Recommender}.
\end{itemize}

This project aims to explore the technologies, methodologies and algorithms that are best suited to approaching the specification outlined above and deliver the results in the form of a modern web application.
